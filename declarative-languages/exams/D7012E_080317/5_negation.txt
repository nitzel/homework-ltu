In the following, assume no other bindings than the above two predicates.
Now, is there any functional difference in the following two goals?

not(notmember(A, [b, c, d, e])).
member(A, [b, c, d, e]).

Explain your conclusion.

There is: While both will be true/false in the same cases, the first one will never assign A but the second one does.
